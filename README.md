# Bisection Method using FSharp
Solves a polynomial equation using bisection method. It is just a small app to get familiar with F# concepts
Highlights:
- Implementing bisection algorithm in an immutable approach
- Using high order functions
- Using WebSharper to expose F# to the web
- Using MathNet.Symbolics to parse and evaluate an equation
